## Development Requirements

This application currently runs on <b>Laravel 9.20</b> and the development requirements to get this application up and
running are as follow:

* PHP 8.1+
* Sqlite
* NPM
* MySQL
* git
* Composer

## Installation

#### Step 1: Clone the repository

php artisan key:generate
``` 

#### Step 7: Run database migration alongside the seeders

```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
``` 

Ensure that your mysql server is up before running the above command

## Starting Development Server

After the installation of the packages and running migrations, then, it's time to start the development server.

Development server can be started in three ways:

* Using ```php artisan serve```
* Using [Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/valet)
* Docker via [Laravel sail](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/sail)

I recommend using valet or Laravel sail to start the development server to ensure that the application works perfectly
across all developers' machines regardless of their operating systems.

#### Note:

* If you are using Laravel sail to start your development server, your default database configuration in the .env should
  be as follow:

```bash
  DB_CONNECTION=mysql
  DB_HOST=mysql
  DB_PORT=3306
  DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
  DB_USERNAME=sail
  DB_PASSWORD=password
```

However, if you want to change the DB username and password after springing forth a docker container using the laravel
sail, update the DB_USERNAME and DB_PASSWORD in the .env with the new details and then run this:

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail down -v
./vendor/bin/sail build --no-cache
./vendor/bin/sail up -d
```
